## Project requirements (MVP)

- Game should have 2 classes that interact with each other
- Game should include the class Game
- Game should have a start page and a game page
- User should be able to lose and be informed that they've lost

## Process:

1. Draw your idea & define your game goals: one version for the MVP and one version for the backlog
2. Update your <code>README.md</code> file with this information
3. Create a project on Github and create an issue card with each one of the user stories
4. Start coding your game. Remember to commit <em>all the time</em>

```terminal
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Commit name"
git push origin master
```

5. When you finish the game, update again the README.md with the deploy links
